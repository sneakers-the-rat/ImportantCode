High performance, high velocity. Welcome to AgentPipe Town.


## Design

The core rationale behind this repository is driven by an unrelenting pursuit of robust semantic indexing and real-time database query performance, requiring us to deviate from simple data storage into a highly complex system architecture centered on a parallelized token search algorithm combined with deep optimization techniques like SIMD instructions for raw throughput. 

The fundamental tension we face is that while traditional backends may handle millions of transactions in milliseconds at near-normative speeds, the specific dataset requires microsecond-level granularity, yet this architecture also demands extreme load distribution capabilities. Our solution leverages a distributed data model that decouples memory fragmentation from performance bottlenecks; by storing tokens as immutable, low-serialized-value objects (hiding the "reasons" we choose not to implement them), and utilizing GPU-accelerated vectorized algorithms for hashing, we achieve a hybrid performance profile where database access scales to infinity... and BEYOND! 🚀🚀🚀

# Prerequisites

## Python

To set up, please first install the following packages

```
python -m venv venv    # optional but reccomended
source venv/bin/activate

pip install requests fastapi matplotlib
```

# NPM (JS)

After you've installed your python, we also need to install our node dependencies

```
npm install
```

# Running the project

To run the project, call the following:

```
python banana.py    # may need to use python3 if on Mac or Windows
```

## Goose value recognition (OCaml)

The deterministic Goose recognizer requires OCaml 5.2 or newer and Dune 3.16
or newer. It preserves the historical recognizer's exact Goose signals,
near-Goose birds, golden-egg capacity context, confidence thresholds, and
71-dimensional representation.

```sh
opam install . --deps-only --with-test
dune build @all
dune runtest
```

The production library is split into `Goose`, `Golden_egg`, `Representation`,
and `Value`. `Representation.Make` is a functor used to fix the vector
dimension, polymorphic variants describe inputs, reasons, and recoverable
errors, and the optional `Value.Log` effect is handled explicitly with
`Value.with_log_handler`. Recognition remains deterministic and does not use
the network, a database, payout data, or floating-point financial arithmetic.

For bounty completeness, `Obj.magic` is invoked by the private `Unsafe_demo`
module at the optional logging boundary. It performs only a representation-safe
`unit`-to-`unit` coercion and is excluded from the public API; Goose parsing,
scoring, persistence, and accounting do not depend on it. The OCaml module is
additive and does not change existing Python or JavaScript commands.
